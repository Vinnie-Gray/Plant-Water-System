# Plant-Water-System
This GitHub contains all of the neccessary files used to develop our project. 
# Exlusive Summary 
Many people struggle to know when the necessary times to water their plants, this project is a solution to that problem. The automatic plant water system is programed to be able to detect the moisture of the dirt and turns on the watering system until the plant is back at the correct moisture. This automatic plant water system will be a great benifit to many people because it saves time and effort, all you need is to make sure your water supply does not run low. This plant water system will wait until it senses a certain point of moisture the plant drops to and then will turn on the watering system and then turnes off after a couple of seconds, then repeats the process.
# Plant Water System Capabilities
The first part of this project we had to set up the water pump and the moisture sensor. The Next part of our project we figured out how to program the sensor to detect when the moisture drops to a certain point and then turn on the water pump. The following lists the plant water system capabilities. 
* Collecting the moisture of the soil and which tells the water pump when it needs to pump out water 
* The water pump making sure the plant is consuming the proper amount of water 
# Who Are We? 
* Vincent Gray - Freshman Electrical Engineering Major- Water Pump Subsystem Developer
* Noah Malik - Freshman Computer Engineering Major- Sensor Subsystem Developer
* Project Stakeholders - This Project was developed for anyone that always struggles with keeping their plants alive. The automatic plant watering system will be the solution to your plants always drying up and dying. This system will ensure your plant will recieve the proper ammount of water it needs to survive.
